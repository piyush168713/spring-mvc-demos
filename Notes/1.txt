How Does Component Scan Work - Your Package Names are Different!

Question

How does component scan work in this example? You have different package names.

You listed the component scan package as: com.luv2code.springdemo

But the our MVC controllers are defined in com.luv2code.springdemo.mvc

Answer
For the Spring attribute:  base-package="com.luv2code.springdemo"

Spring will recursively scan for components starting at the base package: "com.luv2code.springdemo"

When I say "recursive", it means that Spring will start at the base package and scan all sub packages.

The package com.luv2code.springdemo.mvc is a sub package because of naming structure,
just like folders on a file system.

As a result, it will be included in the scan.
